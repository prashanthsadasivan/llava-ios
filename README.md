# LLaVA iOS - Run LLaVA vision model on your phone!
This app lets you run the [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/) multi modal LLM on your iPhone. I've only tested it with iPhone 15 pro, and it will crash fairly often.

This project is built using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). All the LLaVA inference code is ripped from the llava example in there. even the UI bits.

Very much a work in progress. My goal is to take a smaller model and see if i can train it so that it runs much more reliably.
